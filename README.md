# PacMandoro

As part of an interview, I had to create a Pomodoro Technique timer, but, because I was applying for a XAML/C# UWP position, they asked that I also make it look good to demonstrate my UI development skillset.

This is the result:  a Pac-Man themed Pomodoro Technique timer!

This prototype has a fixed set time to demonstrate the animation so it's not a full-functioning Pomodoro Technique timer.
